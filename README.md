# shell

My dynamic replacement for the default PS1. Bash.

```
. shell.sh                 # for nerdfont mode
PS1_MODE=text . shell.sh   # for text mode
```

Execute in bash shell or add to your `.bashrc`

Two modes are available --- "nerdfont" and "text", former is default, latter is toggled by setting `PS1_MODE=text` before applying prompt
